<!-- To open up a new window, the following is what I have as notes.  Watch carefully since it will have a few things we need to do -->

    <h2>Modal Example</h2>

<!-- Trigger/Open The Modal -->

<!-- 

    We need to have something in order to trigger.  This one uses a button.
    Remember that id="myBtn"

    Also, "Open Modal" is the text inside the button

-->
    <button id="myBtn">Open Modal</button>

    <p>Your password is: </p>
    <p id = "passwordgenerated"></p>

<!-- The Modal -->

<!-- 
    
    First, we start out by declaring a value of 'div'.  Remember that with this declaration, we are telling the program 
    that there's going to be a function

    id = "myModal" and class="modal"

-->

<!-- 

    Okay, so two things are happening here.  Let's go step by step:

    id = "myModal" is targetting the Javascript.  This is because in the JS, it is saying to have this line read this:
    var modal = document.getElementById("myModal");

    We're having the variance "modal" INSIDE the Javascript equal to whatever it is in the document, retreiving
    what the element is by Id, which is "myModal"

    The second thing is:
    class="modal"

    On this one, we're calling on the .css file to retrieve the function for .modal.  It is this:

    .modal {


    /* 
        Hidden by default 
        When this is first mentioned, this will be invisible.  Thus, why it says "display: none;"
        
    */
    display: none; 

    /* 

    Stay in place 
    Have it stay in the middle

    */
    position: fixed;


    /* Sit on top */
    z-index: 1; 

    left: 0;
    top: 0;


    /*One of the things we need is to have the window set in place and in a fixed size.  If there were more
    text, then it'll expand it a bit*/
    width: 100%; /* Full width */
    height: 100%; /* Full height */


    /* 

        Enable scroll if needed 
        This is in case that the messag expands and increases in size.

    */
    overflow: auto; 


    background-color: rgb(0,0,0); /* Fallback color */
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4); /* Black w/ opacity */
  }


 -->

    <!-- REMEMBER:  ID is for the JS, CLASS is for the CSS -->
    <div id="myModal" class="modal">

  <!-- Modal content -->

  <!-- Let's go slowly again.  Here, we have

    class = "modal-conent"

    This will cause the call to happen to this:

    .modal-content {
    background-color: #fefefe;
    margin: 15% auto; /* 15% from the top and centered */
    padding: 20px;
    border: 1px solid #888;
    width: 80%; /* Could be more or less, depending on screen size */
  }




-->

        <div class="modal-content">

    <!-- 

        class="close" is called again.  css file:

        .close {
        color: #aaa;
        float: right;
        font-size: 28px;
        font-weight: bold;
        }

     -->

     <!-- This is the little "X" on the window. -->
            <span class="close">&times;</span>

    <!-- 
        
        Have this message change.  We're going to need the following:
        1. Clicking on generate password prompts to a series of questions to make a password.
        2. Length of the password between 8 and 128
        3. Have lowercase(?)
        4. Have uppercse(?)
        5. Have numberic(?)
        6. Have special characters(?)
        7. MUST have at least one in it once validated (ex:  If you said yes to a number, password MUST have a number)
        8. Generates a password from the matching criteria
        9. Displayed as an alert or written on page
    
    -->
            <p id="main"></p>

            <button id="myBtnback">Back</button>

            <!-- Have this visible when clicked.  But when it changes to the next window, disappear. -->
            <button id="myBtnnext">Next</button>
            <br>
            <br>

            <!--
            //Make this invisible first.  When the next button is clicked, have this visible
            <button id="myBtnback">Back</button>
            -->

            <!-- Label inserted.  Now to find out how to extract information to css -->
            <label for="usernumber"></label>
            <p id = "userinput"></p>
            <input type="text" id = "usernumber" name="usernumber"><br><br>

            <button id="btninputyes">Yes</button>
            <button id="btninputno">No</button>

             

            <!-- 
                What we need to do now is have this button link to a box.  First, we initiate by declaring an ID for the button
                In this case, the ID for the button is "myBtnnext"

                This needs to be chained with a function inside the script.  The script is going to be a variance button name.
                In this case, I made the JS script to include a variance named "btnnext", which links back to the button
                declared as "myBtnnext":

                In the JS:  
                //var btnnext = document.getElementById("myBtnnext");

                //<button id="myBtn">Open Modal</button>

                -->
             

        </div>  

    </div>

    <script src="./assets/script.js"></script>
